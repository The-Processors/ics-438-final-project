# ICS 438 Final Project


Go to [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eyea13n3e5gxzo2/tweets.zip?dl=0) for tweets data (~702 Mb compressed, ~2.0 Gb uncompressed).

Unpack contents and move folder into ```[local repo location]/data/```. ```tweets``` will be on the same level as ```covid_data``` and ```counties``` directories.
